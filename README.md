# Create6pythonscripts
Scripts for modpack makers and developers to check if your mods are compatible with Create 6. You will need an Excel file (see README).

The Excel file was adapted from this community-made one :  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sEK9lDrp5nT00MzR6mSGFQzcq04kdcioGFuKwIqiavg/edit?gid=0#gid=0

> [!NOTE]  
> Note that these are helper scripts for you to find mods that aren't compatible; you should check the mods the script gives you against the ones on the Excel mentioned above.

> [!NOTE]  
> By default, `createsixer.py` doesn't give you the unmatched mods, you'll need to enable the option in the config section of the file.
